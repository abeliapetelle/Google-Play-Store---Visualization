## Project description
The dataset I've chosen provide information about the catalogue of applications available on Google Play Store.
The goal of this project was to extract insights about our dataset and do the same data visualisation with Python (matplotlib/seaborn) and with Tableau. 
For instance, in this project I asked the following question: What are the most popular categories of apps by number of installs?

## Visualisation with Python

50% of users have all these same top 9 types of apps bellow, but the types of apps that have the maximum off dowloads are : Game, Video Players, Communication, entertainment and photography

## Visualisation in Tableau

Apps that are the most downloaded in average are communication’s apps followed by video player’s apps

## Conclusion

With matplotlib visualization, you really can do what you want but I was limited because of my technical skills. 
With Tableau, you can create really great visualization but someties it can't do exactly what we want (here, I wanted to do a scatter plot but the software wouldn't do it).
